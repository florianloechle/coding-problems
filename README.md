# Personal Coding Problems

In this repo I'm trying to keep track of all coding problems that I did solve over the course of my programming lifetime.
My solutions might not be perfect but I did try to solve every one of these problems without looking up the best and most optimized solution.

I'm a fan of declarative programming so most of my solutions will follow a declarative approach.
